# Prediction of Product Sales

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict product sales using a dataset provided by Omona Emmanuel. The dataset contains information about various products and their sales across different outlets. The project involves data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset before building predictive models.

## File Description

- `Omona_Emmanuel_Prediction_of_Product_Sales.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data cleaning, preprocessing, and EDA.
- `sales_predictions_2023.csv`: Dataset file containing the raw data used in the analysis.

## Dependencies

- pandas
- numpy
- missingno
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- Google Colab (for notebook execution and visualization)

## Data Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The exploratory data analysis (EDA) section of the project involves:

- **Checking Data Distribution:** Histograms are used to visualize the distribution of numerical features in the dataset.

- **Summary Statistics:** Boxplots provide statistical summaries of numerical features, such as median, quartiles, and outliers.
- **Frequency Analysis:** Countplots are utilized to analyze the frequency of each class in categorical features.
- **Correlation Analysis:** A heatmap is used to visualize the correlation between features in the dataset.

The EDA process helps in understanding the underlying patterns, relationships, and characteristics of the data, which is crucial for building accurate predictive models.

## Usage

To run the notebook locally, ensure you have Python installed along with the required dependencies listed above. Then, execute the cells in the Jupyter Notebook sequentially to perform data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis.
